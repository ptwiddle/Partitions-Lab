Results proven with algebraic geometry
====

[Buryak-Feigin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5640) and later, shorter, and stronger [Buryak-Feigin-Nakajima](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2789) proved product formulas that count partitions with respect to how many cells $\square$ satisfy $\alpha(a(\square))+\beta(\ell(\square)+1)=0$.  Buryak-Feigin-Nakajima actually show more: that these counts "play nicely" with respect to $\alpha+\beta$ cores.




Cores and Quadratic forms
=====
I know of two papers that, seemingly independently, proved that for usual cores partitions, the size of the partition is a quadratic function in terms of the lattice coordinates.

[Cranks and $t$-cores, by Frank Garvan, Dongsu Kim, and Dennis Stanton ](https://qseries.org/fgarvan/papers/tcore.pdf)

Number theorists, they use the result about quadratic forms to give a unified combinatorial proof of the Ramanujan congruences


[Instantons on ALE spaces and orbifold partitions, by Robbert Dijkgraaf, Piotr Su≈Çkowski](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1427) Seemingly independently they prove the size of a core partition is given by a quadratic form.  Their "orbifold partition of the first type" correspond to the coloured box-counting partition but then setting all variables except one to 1; it would be interesting to see if their "orbifold partition of the second type" have any interesting patterns for other coloring schemes.
