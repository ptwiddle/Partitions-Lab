Results proven with algebraic geometry
====

[Generating series of the Poincare polynomials of quasihomogeneous Hilbert schemes by A. Buryak and B. L. Feigin](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5640)

And shorter and stronger

[A simple proof of the formula for the Betti numbers of the quasihomogeneous Hilbert schemes by A. Buryak, B. L. Feigin, H. Nakajima](https://arxiv.org/abs/1302.2789)

These papers use algebraic geometry to prove product formulas that count partitions with respect to how many cells $\square$ satisfy $\alpha a(\square)-\beta(\ell(\square)+1)=0$.  Buryak-Feigin-Nakajima actually show more: that these counts "play nicely" with respect to $\alpha+\beta$ cores: namely, there is a nice product formula containing the statistics above, but restricted to partitions with a given $\alpha+\beta$ core. 




Cores and Quadratic forms
=====
I know of two papers that, seemingly independently, proved that for usual cores partitions, the size of the partition is a quadratic function in terms of the lattice coordinates.

[Cranks and $t$-cores, by Frank Garvan, Dongsu Kim, and Dennis Stanton ](https://qseries.org/fgarvan/papers/tcore.pdf)
Number theorists, they use the result about quadratic forms to give a unified combinatorial proof of the Ramanujan congruences


[Instantons on ALE spaces and orbifold partitions, by Robbert Dijkgraaf, Piotr Su≈Çkowski](https://arxiv.org/abs/0712.1427) 
Seemingly independently they prove the size of a core partition is given by a quadratic form.  Their "orbifold partition of the first type" correspond to the coloured box-counting partition but then setting all variables except one to 1; it would be interesting to see if their "orbifold partition of the second type" have any interesting patterns for other coloring schemes.
