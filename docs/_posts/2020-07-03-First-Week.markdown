Quick blog post highlighting and reminding us what we did in the first week.

We had two meetings: in the first one, I covered a lot of ground quickly to be able to state an open question I thought you could already meaningfully work on, about the generating function for (2,5)-cores.





In the second meeting, we slowed down, and I reviewed Euler's Theorem that partitions into odd parts is equal to partitions into distinct parts, and mentioned that there are three combinatorial proofs of it, and mentioned Glaisher's theorem, a generalization.  As a warm-up to the fermionic view of partitions and Dirac's electron sea, we discussed partitions that fit inside an $a\times b$ box; proved that there are $\binom{a+b}{a}$ of them, and that if we want to count them with size we can do use using the $q$-binomial coefficients.  


In the second part I gave a description of Dirac's electron sea, and that charge zero collections of electrons and protons are in bijection with partitions.
