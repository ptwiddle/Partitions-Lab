Basic links

1. [Mark Haiman's notes on partitions](https://math.berkeley.edu/~mhaiman/math172-spring10/partitions.pdf)
2. Mike Zabrocki wrote an [experimental book on generating functions](http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/MMM1/) with videos, and has some [good notes](http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/math4160f19/notes/ch4_generating_functions.pdf) on generating functions with a lot about partitions at the end. 
3. [Igor Pak's survey on partitions bijections](https://www.math.ucla.edu/~pak/papers/psurvey.pdf) is concise and written more as a reference than a teaching source, but has a lot of material I don't know where to find elsewhere.
4. My paper [Lattice Point and Simultaneous Core Partitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07934) contains a discussion of Dirac's Electron sea, and the abacus.  An [old draft](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.07934v1.pdf) has some discussion of $q$-analogs.
5. My Master's Student [Ashley Warren's thesis](WarrenFinal.pdf) contains a lot of the background of what we're going to need, but warning -- it contains solutions to many of the exercises I'm giving as well.

1. Mike Zabrocki has fun matching exercises on [generating functions of partitions](http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/math4160f19/files/partitionsmatching.pdf), and [Finding generating functions using the Durfee Square](http://garsia.math.yorku.ca/~zabrocki/math4160f19/files/partitionnotmatching.pdf)
